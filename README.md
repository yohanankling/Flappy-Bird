# Flappy Bird Clone

This is a side project where I'm building a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird using Unity. The game is currently a work in progress, and some features are yet to be implemented.

## Gameplay

In this game, the player controls a bird that continuously moves to the right. The player has to tap or click to make the bird flap its wings and gain altitude, avoiding obstacles along the way. The objective is to keep the bird alive for as long as possible, earning points for each pipe the bird successfully passes through.

## Running the Game

Currently, the game can only be run locally on my personal machine. I have not released the code publicly at this time, as the project is still a work in progress.
 However, you can get a glimpse of the game by watching the attached video demonstration.

## Contributing

As this is a personal side project for learning purposes, I'm not actively seeking contributions at the moment. However, if you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
